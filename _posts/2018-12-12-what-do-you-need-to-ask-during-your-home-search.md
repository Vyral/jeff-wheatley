When you’re on the hunt for the perfect home, there are four important questions you should keep in mind:&nbsp;

**1. How’s the neighborhood?** However much you love a home, don’t proceed with purchasing it before you take a hard look at the surrounding area. When you find a home, think about how close you’d be to work and other important places, like grocery stores and schools, if you were to move there. In addition to thinking about your commute, you should also consider how overall trends in the area might impact your ability to sell down the line.&nbsp;<br><br>**2. How are the schools?** Regardless of whether you have children or not, the quality of area schools should be a major factor in your decision. If you do have kids, you will obviously want to know that they’ll be receiving a quality education. Even if you don’t have children, you should realize that the quality of local schools will still play a significant role in your property’s resale value.

**3. What are the average utility costs?** A number of factors, such as age, condition, and the preference of its current owners, can impact a home’s average utility costs. Before you settle on a property, therefore, you should understand what it will cost you to live there. Sellers in Montgomery County are required to disclose this information. &nbsp;<br><br>**4. How old are the major home systems, appliances, and features?** The age of a home’s roof, HVAC system, hot water heater, and other such big-ticket items will give you a better idea of whether these things will need to be replaced any time soon. Ideally, these things should be decently new.&nbsp;
