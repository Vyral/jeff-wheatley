Recently, I visited one of our client’s properties to see what kind of updates it might need before listing. One of the home’s bathrooms stood out right away—it was somewhat small and very dated.&nbsp;

With this in mind, our team decided to make a couple of recommendations with the goal of helping our seller earn the highest return for the lowest financial investment. The first recommendation was for them to reglaze the tub. **For just $350, an old, yellowing bathtub can be made to look like new again.**

Next, we recommended that the client remove the current vanity. There was already a linen closet, so this additional feature was taking up a lot of unnecessary space in the room. Once removed, the seller replaced it with a nice pedestal sink.&nbsp;

Third, we suggested the seller remove the old wallpaper and replace it with a fresh coat of paint. When coupled with our final recommendation, switching out the flooring with luxury vinyl tile, this made the room really pop.&nbsp;

The updates you make within your own home before selling will depend largely on your specific property. Our team would be happy to make recommendations, so if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out. We look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
