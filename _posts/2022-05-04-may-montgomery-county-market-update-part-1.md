Are we headed for a correction in the Montgomery County real estate market? I’m going to begin to answer that question today in part one of my May market update.&nbsp;

Real estate is a supply and demand game, and today we’re focusing on the supply side to discover where our market is headed in terms of prices. Next time, we’ll focus on demand, and after that, we’ll bring them both together.
