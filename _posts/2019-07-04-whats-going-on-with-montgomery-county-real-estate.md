Today I just wanted to take a moment to update you on what’s going on in the Montgomery County market. **Here’s what you need to know.**

**Our median sale price in May was at $468,000, which is the second-highest number we’ve ever seen.** This number was found by determining that we had 1,325 closed sales. This is 2.8% higher than the typical May numbers.

The next thing to take a look at is pending sales. We have 1,575 right now, which is 3.6% above last year and 1.7% above our five-year average for May. A lot of times when we see this level of pendings and closed sales, we’re going to see a significant increase in active properties. Those are up 1.6% to 2,432. **As you can see, we have a lot of activity in the Montgomery County market.**

What does this mean for buyers and sellers? Our market remains pretty neutral, with a slight edge to sellers. Our inventory is on the rise and up to 2.8 months. Typically, when we get to three months, things start to shift toward buyers.

**In May of 2019, over 50% of the homes that went on the market sold for either full price or higher.** I found that very interesting. Finally, I wanted you to know that we saw an increase in the townhouse market and a bit of a slowdown in detached condos.

If you have any questions for me about the market or how you can take advantage of the current conditions, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
