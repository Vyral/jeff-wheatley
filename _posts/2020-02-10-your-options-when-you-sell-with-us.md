When it comes to selling a home, what options do you have? After all, not all sellers list their properties for the same reasons; it follows that different sellers should have different paths to success tailored around their needs. Today I’ll share just three of the options available to you when you sell your home with the Wheatley Group:

**Option No. 1: Quick Cash-Out**

If you need to sell your home fast and just want a cash-out, we have an option that will allow for a quick sale with no commission fees or closing costs. We can round out the transaction in just seven to nine days.

**Option No. 2: Full Marketing Blitz**

This second option is more traditional: we’ll do a full marketing blitz that will attract the maximum number of offers and earn you the highest possible sale price for your home in its current condition. This is one of our most popular options.

**Option No. 3: Renovation**

Many sellers will get more money out of their homes if they renovate them to today’s standards. That includes updating things like paint, carpet, and bathroom finishes. Once that’s finished, we’ll then stage the home and do a full market blitz to sell at the highest price possible.

In addition to these options, we can also come in to do a seller consultation to make sure that we understand your timeframe. Many people have very specific timeframes in mind, so we structure the transaction around those needs.

We’ll also help you **determine what type of liquidity event you need.** Some might need some money from outside of the property prior to closing; if you need to put money down on your next house or some other investment before closing, we can arrange that for you.

Lastly, when you sell with us, **we’ll do an analysis to make sure that selling is in your best financial interest.** Many properties in today’s market could become huge investment opportunities down the road if you bought and held them for 10 or so years.

Any of these options can work for you, but which one you should choose depends on your needs. If you have any questions or would like our help in navigating your next home sale, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We would love to discuss the best path forward given your circumstances.
