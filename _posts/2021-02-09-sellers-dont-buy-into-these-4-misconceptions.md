<center><em>If you&rsquo;re thinking of selling, don&rsquo;t believe these common misconceptions.</em></center>

<br>In our current market, homes are selling in just days (sometimes hours) after being listed. This has created four main misconceptions some sellers have chosen to believe but you shouldn’t if you’re thinking of selling your home soon:

**1\. You can sell your home as is** (i.e., not prepping it well). While the market will absorb any property that’s priced well, if you don’t do the proper staging, you won’t sell for top dollar. If you want to maximize your sale price, it’s important to stage your home properly.

**2\. Listing your home with a discount broker will still yield a great result**. The reality is, birds of a feather flock together. If you work with a discount brokerage, you’ll get what you pay for. Discount brokers tend to bring discount offers with lots of contingencies and consternations. If you want a clean sale with the most amount of money, pick a great broker.

**3\. You can price your home for any amount you want**. You still need to employ proper pricing to attract the most offers. The highest number of offers will create an auction effect, drive up the price, release all contingencies, and put you in control so no one will try to retrade on you once you’re under contract. We recently listed a home at its proper price that eventually fetched 42 offers, which drove the value up 12%. It can happen to you too; you just have to trust the marketplace.

**4\. The buyers set all the contingencies, not sellers**. That’s how it usually goes in a traditional market, but in our tight-inventory market, you have the power to set the contingencies. The contingency we’re implementing the most is the seller’s home of choice, meaning you can write a contract that’s contingent on you finding your next home before accepting an offer.
