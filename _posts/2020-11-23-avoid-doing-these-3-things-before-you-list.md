<center><em>To receive top dollar for your home, make sure to avoid these mistakes before listing.</em></center>

<br>Today I’ll discuss three things that you should not do before you list your home on the market:

**1\. Focus on secondary rooms**. In previous videos, we’ve discussed the importance of the kitchen, master bathroom, and laundry room. However, beyond making sure your secondary rooms are clean and tidy, you don’t want to spend too much money on those areas.

**2\. Overspend on materials**. As we get a property ready for the market, we’ll go room to room to see what can be refreshed using paint or carpet. Now, there are instances where we’ll need different surfaces. Most of the time, we’re using a product that’s new to the market called Luxury Vinyl Tile, which gives you a great bang for your buck, and it’s significantly easier and cheaper to reinstall than hardwood.

**3\. Upgrade your home’s mechanicals**. Take your HVAC system; no one is going to come to your home and want to buy it because you have a brand-new HVAC system. They’re going to look at the fit, finish, and the emotional reasons to buy your home. If your HVAC system doesn’t work, it needs to be serviced to an operable condition. But in most cases, we’ll add a home warranty that will cover the buyers for up to their first year just to make sure they feel great about the property.

If you’d like to discuss your individual circumstances or you have any questions, please reach out to me directly.
