As of June 1, we started to see a bit of a lull in home sales and were able to take advantage of that by putting an investor client under contract. The market is still as hot as ever, we just had a slight pullback over the long holiday weekend.

Make sure you’re ready if there’s another lull, which should be coming sometime in August. **If you’re looking for an investment property, August may be your best opportunity**.

If you have any questions for me about this topic or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
