<p style="text-align: center;"><em>When you work with a team of Realtors, there are many people working behind the scenes on behalf of your success.</em></p>


When you work with a team of Realtors, there are many people working behind the scenes on behalf of your success. **Some of these people make up what’s referred to in the real estate industry as an “inside sales agent” (or ISA) team.&nbsp;**

This team takes care of backend support tasks so that your agent can focus on their job: serving you. This team will also have a major role to play in developing and distributing marketing materials, and one of the methods the ISA team within our firm crafts the most effective marketing messages possible is by using the pyramid structure illustrated in today’s video.&nbsp;

**At the top of the pyramid is the word “who.”** This prompt is meant to guide the ISA team to think about what their ideal audience should be.&nbsp;

**In the middle of the pyramid, there’s the word “what.”** Once the team has determined who they’re going to sending their message to, they will nail down what the message will be.&nbsp;

**Finally, the bottom of the pyramid consists of the words “how” and “medium”.** These words represent the question “How will the inside sales agents deliver this message, and what medium will they use?” The way the ISA team delivers a marketing message, as well as the various materials and methods they use to send it out, will all have an impact on how it’s received.&nbsp;

The more technical aspects of what an ISA team does within a real estate firm aren’t something you, as a buyer or seller, need to worry about, but the important thing is that you understand how hard our entire team works on behalf of your success.
