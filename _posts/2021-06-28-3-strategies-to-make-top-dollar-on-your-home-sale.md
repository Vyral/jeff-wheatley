Whenever someone boasts about selling their home within a day of putting it on the market, the only thing I can think is, “How much money did they leave on the table?” Though it’s easy to sell a home quickly in our market, quick doesn’t exactly mean profitable. To ensure you’re getting all you can out of your home sale, today we’ll be talking about the three things sellers should do to avoid leaving money on the table.

**1\.&nbsp;****Let the property sit on the market for at least four to six days:** Most of our offers are increasing by as much as 7% by the fourth day of listing, so closing the deal early means missing out on big profits. Most bank-owned homes remain on the market for an entire week before accepting an offer, and it may be a good idea to follow their lead.

**2\. Make effective use of the “coming soon” status:** By using this status, the MLS allows us to pre-market homes for up to 21 days before listing. It builds a ton of enthusiasm and excitement for the property, which creates competition among buyers. So, make sure to get some fantastic photos and capitalize on the “coming soon” status as early as possible.

**3\. If you receive multiple offers, don’t choose over the weekend:** Most people will do more out of fear of loss, so they may decide their original offer wasn’t competitive enough and make a new one on Monday morning. Additionally, buyer agents are incredibly busy over the weekends, so they have less time to check in with clients and make sure the offer is their best. There’s much more availability on Mondays and Tuesdays.

If you follow these tips, you’re much more likely to get a better deal when selling your home. If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
