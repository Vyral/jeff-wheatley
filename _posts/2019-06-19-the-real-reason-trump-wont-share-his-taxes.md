What’s the real reason President Trump won’t share his taxes? It’s because, as a real estate developer, he should be paying very little in terms of his tax burden.

How is this possible? There are several ways you can legally avoid paying capital gains taxes for real estate investments. **For your convenience, I’ve provided timestamps of the video above where I discuss each of these strategies:**

1:21—The 1031 exchange<br>2:15—The harvest<br>3:27—Depreciation<br>4:40—Partnerships<br>5:51—IRS provision<br>6:56—Stepped-up basis&nbsp;

Keep in mind, I’m not a CPA, so if you have any questions about any of these strategies, be sure to get in touch with a certified tax professional.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about any other real estate topics, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.<br>&nbsp;
