<center><em>I&rsquo;m answering two questions about solar panels and hardscaping projects.</em></center>

<br>I recently received some interesting questions about getting a return on investments for projects in your home.

**Should I install solar panels?**

Solar panels are popular right now, but don’t expect them to increase your home’s value or give you a return on investment in the next 15 years. You’ll save money on reduced electricity costs, but you won’t get more money from your house’s sale. Also, some buyers simply don’t want to deal with solar panels, so they may not consider your home.

**Should I do hardscaping around my property?**

Extensive hardscaping only earns you about 30¢ for every dollar you spend, so only pursue it for personal enjoyment, not for return on investment. However, small landscaping projects such as fresh mulch and flowers give you more than a 100% return.

If you have any questions about these home projects or anything concerning real estate, please give me a call or email me. I would love to help you.
