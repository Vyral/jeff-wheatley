When you’re not fully committed to an agent, they’re not fully committed to you. In this market, it’s important to find the right agent, make the commitment, and go deep on your goals. The “right” agent is someone with experience who is going to be able to win against multiple-offer scenarios.&nbsp;

Additionally, **you want someone with a strong database of contacts and relationships with local agents so they can find those properties that aren’t available on the open market.** Landlord relationships help, too.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about how to find off-market properties, winning in multiple offer situations, or real estate in general, don't hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.
