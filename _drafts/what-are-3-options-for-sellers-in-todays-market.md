<center><em>Here are three popular options for homeowners who want to sell.</em></center>

<br>Have you ever noticed that most real estate agents assume they know what you want and try to fit you into one specific box? The reality is that there are a number of available options for home sellers in his marketplace. Here are three of them:

**1\. A quick cash closing**. This allows you to pick the exact closing date and perhaps even stay past that a little bit to find your new home.

**2\. A full marketing blitz**. This exposes you to the most number of buyers and drives the highest price. The pitfall is that it’s not quite as quick as the first option.

**3\. Renovate the property**. This will drive the home price to the maximum sale price in today's market. However, it typically takes up to six weeks to complete those renovations, but it also gives you time to find your new home.

If you are interested in selling your home, feel free to reach out with any questions or to learn more about any of the options you have. I look forward to hearing from you.
