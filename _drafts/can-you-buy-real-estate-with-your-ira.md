Can you buy real estate with your IRA? The simple answer is yes, you can\! We are working with a couple of clients who are currently buying or selling real estate with their IRA, so today I wanted to share a simple plan that will show you how you, too, can buy and sell real estate with your IRA.

**First, find and investigate a custodian, the IRA company holding the assets**. Our team uses a company called Equity Trust, but there are many great providers out there.

Next, set down your objectives. When you’re buying a property in an IRA, you can either go all cash or up to 50% of the loan value. That means if you have $150,000, you could control $300,000 in assets.

**Once you decide what your objectives are, it’s time to go shopping**. Put the property under contract under the name of the third party (custodian), and then go to closing. All funds will go through that custodian; you won’t take any direct receipts of that.

A follow-up question I’ve heard is, “Should I go through a traditional or Roth IRA?” Both can be great vehicles, but which is best for you depends on your individual needs and long-term objectives.

If you’d like to discuss this topic any further, give us a call directly. Hope to hear from you soon\!
